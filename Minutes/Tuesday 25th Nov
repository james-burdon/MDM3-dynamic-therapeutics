Controlled experiment for extracting the data

How are we going to define our question? Understand whether posture is directly affecting hormone trends
-Take accelerometer data
-Use that to predict at any point in time what their posture is within that time series
-Take time series of hormones, and find what's causing that - correlate time series of activity and hormones
-Is the hormones changes directly impacted by activity?
-Are they cyclic or are they related to a specific activity/posture change
-Can we correlate hormone changes to changes in posture
Comparison:
-Activity spike vs hormone spike
-Looking at sub trends - is there a relationship or between high activity and spiking? 

Data advice
Make hormone data is a higher resolution
Filter data: take a slice, 1/2 a second rather than 250Hz, match this to activity log, extrapolate data - by assuming the posture is the same until any new label

Models to use:
-Time series analysis
-Correlation analysis
-Random forest
