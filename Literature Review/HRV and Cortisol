Heart Rate Variability and Cortisol

Research Paper: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5967249/#S10

Background:
HRV - fluctuation in time between heart beats
What does HRV tell us? Indication of body's adaptability and autonomic nervous system balance. We have two nervous systems: parasympathetic (rest/digest) and sympathetic (fight or flight).
High HRV -> fitness and resilience
Low HRV -> stress/fatigue, suggests potential health issues
Cortisol - body's main stress hormone
Calculate HRV using RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) - standard statistical measurement 
RMSSD characterises short term rapid changes in HR  and is strongly correlated to parasympathetic activity and is widely used in wearable-based research

Experiment Details:
Participants underwent laboratory stress task with stages:
Baseline -> Anticipation (prep for stress task 10 mins) -> Stress task -> Recovery 
HRV was monitored throughout the experiment and 7 salivary cortisol samples were taken immediately before the task, after and 5 more times subsequently in 10 min intervals

Findings:
Participants who had a larger decrease in HRV during anticipation had higher increases of cortisol in response to the stress task
HRV changes during the stress task were not strongly correlated with cortisol response 
Therefore, HRV appears to reflect an individual’s underlying capacity for stress regulation, rather than immediate responses during the stressor itself.

Takeaways:
Cortisol influences HRV through it's effect on the autonomic nervous system indirectly. Cortisol increases sympathetic activity and decreases parasympathetic influence which ultimately lowers HRV (RMSSD)
Therefore, can say that HRV reflects stress-related autonomic nervous system activity which is driven by hormones such as cortisol. Therefore we can interpret HRV to give us indirect insight into stress hormone activity.
For our report, we hypothesise that participants with lower HRV levels may exhibit larger cortisol responses.
