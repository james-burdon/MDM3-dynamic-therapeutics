Qs for Thomas:
What is the motivation/what are you looking to get out of this research?
How much data do you have and in what format is it in?
From your initial understanding, what is the relationship between posture and hormone levels?
What wearables can we borrow?
What other health metrics should we look into? If any? Heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature
How many classifications of hormones and postures?
What other features do we need to consider? Age/Gender/BMI

TA: Adam Morris
Data - what's available, format, labels

Hypothesis: predict hormone data off posture
Predict hormone - regression problem
Classify posture from hormones? Rather than predicting hormone levels - predict the change of hormone level 
Hormone changes based on postures and activity 

*What is the motivation/most useful to them? - What is the success metric - WHAT IS THEIR PRIORITY (get a list) TO GET OUT OF THIS REPORT?*

MDS UPDRS - measure of different activities, and received an aggregate score. Limitations: different activities I,.e. walking and touching fingers, some may score well and some may perform badly but receive the same score, additioanlly, done in a clinic - patients have more stress levels and perform poorly
Part 3) Motor symptoms - related to posture
Therefore, this project, in their home - accelerometer, barometer, gyrometer - what sensors are used? Are there pretrained models for these sensors?

Sphere project - posture detection, sit to stand (change in posture) - all you need to track is your head, sphere challenge - detecting activity
Provisional labels

If we have a 20 minute label - where are we taking our prediction, at the end? In the middle? Is the posture 5 seconds before or 

To do:
Sphere papers
Postrue deteciton papers from videos/wearables 
Ask: What wearables are the patients using
Mobilised - D, have simple model used to classify the gate i..e walking, running, sitting
