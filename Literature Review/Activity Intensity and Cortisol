Experiment Details:
Paper investigates how different intensity levels of exercise affect cortisol levels
Blood was taken pre and post 30 mins of exercise (rest, 40%, 60%, 80% intensity - using V02Max)

Findings:
40% intensity (light exercise) showed a decrease in cortisol
60% intensity (moderate) showed an increase with 80% showing the biggest increase

Takeaways:
The more intense the exercise, the greater the increase in cortisol
For our report, we must consider different intensity levels
