Current situation:
-> Working model to ~70% accuracy of accelerometer + HR data -> posture. Works 80%+ for sitting and standing and low for lying
-> Model created for accelarometer -> activity

Ideas going forward:
-> Remove lying down data, how does this improve correlation matrix? (Emma)
-> Send email to Thomas regarding if we can get more data and wearables (Liv - done in meeting)
-> Look into removing activities for posture -> activity model (James)
-> THE BIG Q: How do we want to construct our model's architecture? Are we going hormone -> HR+accel -> Posture OR HR -> Hormones

RESEARCH
-> Suggested order: Accelerometer -> Activity (include HR + hormone) -> predict posture but investigate if this is the most appropriate (Liv + Zhou)
-> Research other metrics which are related to hormones (Liv + Zhou)
-> Try and find alternative data source for hormones and HR (Liv + Zhou)
-> Research EDF data (Callum)
