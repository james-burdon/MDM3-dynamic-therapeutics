Introduction
Motivation

Data Preparation
-> All data sets used (explanation of each, what do they contain, what do the individual metrics mean)
-> All data that we cleaned and how it was cleaned (what was ignored and justification)



Exploratory Data Analysis
-> Looking for correlations between data sets (this is the motivation for predicting posture)
-> How does this lead to a hypothesis of which metrics we expect to accurately predict posture?
-> Use literature to explain why we believe these hypotheses.
-> Explain limitations before leading onto prediction metrics


Posture prediction metrics
-> Why did we use random forest
-> Models predicting posture (subsection for each, lead on from the exploratory data analysis)
-> Hyperparameter tuning

Results and Discussion
-> One big results table? Show all the different models, all the accuracies
-> Discussion, how can we use literature to validate conclusions, what were the conclusions using other datasets and how does that compare to the results that we have
