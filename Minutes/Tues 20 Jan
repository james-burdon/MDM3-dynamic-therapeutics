Discussion:
Build up predicter model based off other features/metrics - can we predict cortisol levels?
What other metrics can we come up with using the given data that we can use to make predictions on hormone levels?
Can we predict the change (how big) in cortisol between beginning and end of day based off metrics i..e stress, activity, HR
Another predictor - ignore metrics - based off activity log/what did they say they did (self reported) - can we predict hormones ?
What is the best predictor?
Look into nonlinear and linear models

Yani advice:
Start with simplest model and aim to improve
Can we find data with more hormones?

Tasks to do:
Base-level: Self reported activity -> change in cortisol level (James)
Questionnaire -> changes in cortisol level (Callum)
Sleep -> changes in cortisol level (Zhou)
Actigraphy -> changes in cortisol level (Emma)
Research metrics and previous experiment to find which metrics should be the most useful for the model (Liv)
