Background:
Cortisol is regulated by the HPA axis and is secreted in  an ultradian rhythm
Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm (24 hour cycle), peaking at the sleep-wake transition and declines throughout the day
Lowest points are in the evening/nighttime
Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is a phenomenon that describes how there are sharp rises in cortisol within the first hour of waking up, partially independent of the circadian rhythm.

Paper description:
Looks at multiple different sleep and cortisol studies, recognising patterns across 24 hour periods
Looks into circadian misalignment (such as shift workers), sleep deprivation and how it affects peak cortisol spikes, timing and evening levels

Findings:
Small changes in circadian rhythm do not have a big effect on cortisol timing shifts but chronic changes do, resulting in reduced overall cortisol exposure. 
Substantial sleep restriction (getting less than 5.5 hours a night) increases late afternoon/early evening cortisol, whereas morning cortisol is inconsistent, suggests due to CAR. 
Cortisol should drop in the evening, if this is not the case this could be linked to further issues such as metabolic dysfunction or insulin resistance.

Takeaways:
Poor sleep doesn’t always increase the amount of cortisol levels but it does change the timing/disrupts when levels are elevated. Therefore, 2 people could release the same amount of cortisol but have very different temporal patterns based off the sleep they had/timing.
Disrupted sleep and sleep restriction are associated with elevated evening cortisol levels.
Cortisol is affected by sleep timing, duration and effectiveness (therefore justifying the inclusion of sleep timing, duration, and quality metrics in our model)
