Look through data
Find metrics and labels
Train model
Colmpute F1 score and confusion matrices
Split data in training, validating and test


Use labels, but predict posture based solely off  x,y,z data
Need posture data… start looking at alternative data - sphere.
Start by using ECG data to validate our model as this is expected (we know how heart rate should vary)
Then look at hormones such as glucose
Which hormones follow similar trends to posture?
Stick to posture prediction - use hormone data only for analysis
